# Classes

W&B is a great tool for learning and collaboration. We offer free academic accounts, and we've collected some good resources for helping you and your students navigate complex machine learning projects.

## Features

**Academic Teams**

Request an [academic team](https://www.wandb.com/academic) to get started having your students submit results to a shared workspace. Grading projects is easy when you can see the real, tracked results and the code that students used to generate models.

**Reports**

Ask your students to submit reports so you can explore their results and compare new projects against previous baselines. Reports make it easy to describe intermediate results and show progress, and all the graphs are connected to real model results that you can reproduce.

**Competitions**

Create a project in your academic team, and have your students compete to achieve the best accuracy on a shared task. Here's a screenshot of an example competition. Each row is a different experiment, and users are competing for the highest accuracy. [View the project →](https://app.wandb.ai/wandb/feb8-emotion)

## Resources

### Example script repo

We've built up a set of working examples of deep learning projects in different frameworks.

We also created some hosted notebooks with models that your students can start training for free with the click of a button.

* [PyTorch](http://bit.ly/wandb-pytorch-intro) introduction with screenshots
* [Keras ](http://bit.ly/wandb-keras-colab)MNIST example
* [TensorFlow 2](http://bit.ly/wandb-tf-colab) convolutional neural network

### **Tutorials**

Lukas and Chris have built a library of short tutorial projects with notes on each class section. Reach out to vanpelt@wandb.com with questions.
