# Artifacts Examples

Walk through an example of Artifacts in a live notebook.

[**Try the notebook →**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wandb/examples/blob/master/colabs/wandb-artifacts/Pipeline\_Versioning\_with\_W%26B\_Artifacts.ipynb)

To see how you can use Artifacts to version control tabular data, check out [this report](http://wandb.me/TBV-Dedup).

For more in-depth examples, try our two GitHub demo projects:

1. [**Dataset versioning**](https://github.com/wandb/artifacts-examples/tree/master/dataset-versioning)**:** An end-to-end example of how to version datasets with W\&B artifacts.
2. [**Detectron 2**](https://github.com/wandb/artifacts-examples/tree/master/detectron2): Image segmentation and bounding box prediction— visualize training metrics and predictions in real time, store and organize trained models, automatically track model fine-tuning, and save results
