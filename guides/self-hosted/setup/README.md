2. [Dedicated Cloud](dedicated-cloud.md): A managed, dedicated deployment on W\&B's single-tenant infrastructure in your choice of cloud region.&#x20;
3. [On-Prem / Bare Metal](on-premise-baremetal.md): W\&B supports setting up a production server on most bare metal servers in your on-premise data centers.
