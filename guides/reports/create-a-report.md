Select the **Filter run sets** option to prevent new runs from being added to your report. You can toggle this option on or off. Once you click **Create report,** a draft report will be available in the report tab to continue working on.

### Create a report from the report tabâ€Œ <a href="#2.-from-the-report-page" id="2.-from-the-report-page"></a>

Navigate to the **Reports** tab in your project and select the **Create Report** button on the report page. This creates a new blank report. Save a report to get a shareable link, or send charts to the report from different workspaces, and different projects.
