# W\&B Launch

_W\&B Launch is in early development, and we're actively working on more integrations, configuration options, and tools for features like automatically triggered jobs. Please reach out to us at support@wandb.com with any questions or suggestions._

W\&B Launch is our new platform for reproducing runs and orchestrating experiments. Launch provides a streamlined way to:

* Execute runs automatically across infrastructure providers in reproducible, containerized environments
* Rerun previous runs with new hyperparameters, models, or datasets
* Containerize and execute runs from publicly hosted remote repositories
* Create and manage queues of runs through the UI or CLI, accessible to team members

## Quickstart example

:arrow\_forward: Start by adding `instant replay` to your user bio on your profile page! This unlocks the UI for using W\&B Launch.

_Note: First, make sure your installation of wandb is up to date, and that you have Docker installed and running._

### Launch CLI

Open the public [launch-welcome project](https://wandb.ai/wandb/launch-welcome), pick a run, and take a look. This project contains example runs of a Jupyter notebook that runs 10 epochs of a simple model on the MNIST dataset. Let's say we want to try training this model again, but with a different dropout rate. Copy the run URL and run something like this:

`wandb launch`[ `https://wandb.ai/wandb/launch-welcome/runs/2er1eom2`](https://wandb.ai/wandb/launch-welcome/runs/2er1eom2) `-a dropout=0.7`

This should kick off a new run on your machine in a container that exactly duplicates the code and execution environment of the example run â€” except now with dropout 0.7. You can then see the new run on your W\&B project page, listed as forked from the previous run.

### Launch UI

You can also use Launch through the W\&B web interface. Open the launch-welcome project again, open the dropdown by a run, and select **Add to Launch queue**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/launch.gif)

A modal should appear, pre-populated with the original config values in the run. Edit this config to change any of the original parameters, select the entity and project you'd like to send the run to then click **Push Run**.

You've now queued an edited version of the run, which is now waiting to be picked up by an agent. Back in your terminal, run:

`wandb launch-agent <your-selected-project-name>`

If you happened to queue the run to anything other than the default queue, add `-q <queue-name>` to your command. You should see that the agent picks up the run and builds a container with your edits to the run, just as before.

Now that you've launched runs via the CLI and the UI, take a look at the documentation to integrate Launch with your infrastructure and workflow.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can I use launch to create new runs?

`wandb launch` supports running new runs (i.e. runs not based on an existing wandb run) from both remote git repositories or local directories.

To launch from a git repo, run the same launch commands as above but with the URL to a Github, GitLab, or Bitbucket repo, e.g. `wandb launch https://github.com/user/repo`. We require that the repo contain either a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` configuration file for dependencies, and the code should be already instrumented with wandb for us to track it as normal.

To launch from a local directory, run with a local path, e.g. `wandb launch path/to/local`. As with git repos, we also require a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` file at the root of the provided path. Queueing is not currently supported for launching from a local directory.

In both cases, you'll want to specify an entry point using the `--entry-point` or `-E` flag.

### Does every agent have to work from the same queue?

No, different agents can listen to different queues. You can manage your run queues in the Launch Tab within a project workspace. This way you can set up a run queue for different machines or different users.

To create a new run queue:

1. Go to your [project page](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/app/pages/project-page), and click on the Launch tab. Create, delete and view the runs in each queue within a [project workspace](../../ref/app/pages/project-page.md#workspace-tab).
2. Click the "Create Queue" button to create a new run queue. If your project is inside a team, you can create a private queue, or you can create a queue that is available to the entire team.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (149).png>)

You can specify the name of the queue for an agent to use using the `wandb launch-agent --queues <queue-name> <project>`

### Can I connect agents to different queues?

An agent can run jobs from a single queue or multiple queues at a time, specified as a list of comma-separated names, e.g. `--queues q1,q2,q3`. If you don't specify a queue with the `--queues` flag, the agent will run jobs from the default queue for the project.

### How can I delete a run queue?

Full run queues can be deleted as well. Select the queue or queues to be deleted, and click delete. This will delete queued runs that have not started, but not delete any runs that have been started.

The project's default queue cannot be deleted.
