# Start sweep agents

Start a W\&B Sweep on one or more agents on one or more machines. W\&B Sweep agents query the Weights & Biases server you launched when you initialized a W\&B Sweep (`wandb sweep)` for hyperparameters and use them to run model training.

To start a W\&B Sweep agent, provide the W\&B Sweep ID that was returned when you initialized a W\&B Sweep. The W\&B Sweep ID has the form:

```bash
entity/project/sweep_ID
```

Where:

* entity: Your Weights & Biases username or team name.
* project:  The name of the project where you want the output of the W\&B Run to be stored.  If the project is not specified, the run is put in an "Uncategorized" project.
* sweep\_ID: The pseudo random, unique ID generated by W\&B.

Provide the name of the function the W\&B Sweep will execute if you start a W\&B Sweep agent within a Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

The proceeding code snippets demonstrate how to start an agent with Weights & Biases. We assume you already have a configuration file and you have already initialized a W\&B Sweep. For more information about how to define a configuration file, see [Define sweep configuration](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/define-sweep-configuration).

{% tab title="Python script or Jupyter Notebook" %}
Use the Weights & Biases Python SDK library to start a sweep. Provide the sweep ID that was returned when you initialized the sweep. In addition, provide the name of the function  the sweep will execute.

```python
wandb.agent(sweep_id=sweep_id, function=function_name)
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="CLI" %}
Use the `wandb agent` command to start a sweep. Provide the sweep ID that was returned when you initialized the sweep. Copy and paste the code snippet below and replace `sweep_id` with your sweep ID:

```bash
wandb agent sweep_id
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Stop W\&B agent

{% hint style="warning" %}
Random and Bayesian searches will run forever. You must stop the process from the command line, within your python script, or the [Sweeps UI](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/app/features/sweeps).
{% endhint %}

Optionally specify the number of W\&B Runs a Sweep agent should try. The following code snippets demonstrate how to set a maximum number of [W\&B Runs](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/run) with the CLI and within a Jupyter Notebook, Python script.&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python script or Jupyter Notebook" %}
First, initialize your sweep. For more information, see [Initialize sweeps](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/initialize-sweeps).

```
sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep_config)
```

Next, start the sweep job. Provide the sweep ID generated from sweep initiation. Pass an integer value to the count parameter to set the maximum number of runs to try.

```python
sweep_id, count = "dtzl1o7u", 10
wandb.agent(sweep_id, count=count)
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="CLI" %}
First, initialize your sweep with the [`wandb sweep`](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/cli/wandb-sweep) command. For more information, see [Initialize sweeps](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/initialize-sweeps).

```
wandb sweep config.yaml
```

Pass an integer value to the count flag to set the maximum number of runs to try.

```
NUM=10
SWEEPID="dtzl1o7u"
wandb agent --count $NUM $SWEEPID
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
