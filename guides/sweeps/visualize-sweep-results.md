# Visualize sweep results

Visualize the results of your Weights & Biases Sweeps with the W\&B App UI. Navigate to the W\&B App UI at [https://wandb.ai/home](https://wandb.ai/home). Choose the project that you specified when you initialized a W\&B Sweep. You will be redirected to your project [workspace](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/app/pages/workspaces). Select the **Sweep icon** on the left panel (broom icon). From the [Sweep UI](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/app/features/sweeps), select the name of your Sweep from the list.&#x20;

By default, Weights & Biases will automatically create a parallel coordinates plot, a parameter importance plot, and a scatter plot when you start a W\&B Sweep job.&#x20;

Parallel coordinates charts summarize the relationship between large numbers of hyperparameters and model metrics at a glance. For more information on parallel coordinates plots, see [Parallel coordinates](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/app/features/panels/parallel-coordinates).

The scatter plot(left) compares the W\&B Runs that were generated during the Sweep. For more information about scatter plots, see [Scatter Plots](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/app/features/panels/scatter-plot).

The parameter importance plot(right) lists the hyperparameters that were the best predictors of, and highly correlated to desirable values of your metrics. For more information parameter importance plots, see [Parameter Importance](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/app/features/panels/parameter-importance).

You can alter the dependent and independent values (x and y axis) that are automatically used. Within each panel there is a pencil icon called **Edit panel**. Choose **Edit panel**. A model will appear. Within the modal, you can alter the behavior of the graph.

For more information on all default W\&B visualization options, see [Panels](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/app/features/panels). See the [Data Visualization docs](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/data-vis) for information on how to create plots from W\&B Runs that are not part of a W\&B Sweep.
