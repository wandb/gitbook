# Troubleshooting

### If wandb crashes, will it possibly crash my training run?

It is extremely important to us that we never interfere with your training runs. We run wandb in a separate process to make sure that if wandb somehow crashes, your training will continue to run. If the internet goes out, wandb will continue to retry sending data to [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai).

### **Why is a run marked crashed in W\&B when it’s training fine locally?**

This is likely a connection problem — if your server loses internet access and data stops syncing to W\&B, we mark the run as crashed after a short period of retrying.

### Does logging block my training?

"Is the logging function lazy? I don't want to be dependent on the network to send the results to your servers and then carry on with my local operations."

Calling `wandb.log` writes a line to a local file; it does not block any network calls. When you call `wandb.init` we launch a new process on the same machine that listens for filesystem changes and talks to our web service asynchronously from your training process.

### How do I stop wandb from writing to my terminal or my jupyter notebook output?

Set the environment variable [`WANDB_SILENT`](../track/advanced/environment-variables.md) to `true`.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
os.environ["WANDB_SILENT"] = "true"
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Jupyter Notebook" %}
```python
%env WANDB_SILENT=true
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Command Line" %}
```python
WANDB_SILENT=true
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### How do I kill a job with wandb?

Press `Ctrl+D` on your keyboard to stop a script that is instrumented with wandb.

### How do I deal with network issues?

If you're seeing SSL or network errors:`wandb: Network error (ConnectionError), entering retry loop`. You can try a couple of different approaches to solving this issue:

1. Upgrade your SSL certificate. If you're running the script on an Ubuntu server, run `update-ca-certificates` We can't sync training logs without a valid SSL certificate because it's a security vulnerability.
2. If your network is flaky, run training in [offline mode](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/launch#is-it-possible-to-save-metrics-offline-and-sync-them-to-w-and-b-later) and sync the files to us from a machine that has Internet access.
3. Try running [W\&B Private Hosting](../self-hosted/), which operates on your machine and doesn't sync files to our cloud servers.

`SSL CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`: this error could be due to your company's firewall. You can set up local CAs and then use:

`export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`

### What happens if internet connection is lost while I'm training a model?

If our library is unable to connect to the internet it will enter a retry loop and keep attempting to stream metrics until the network is restored. During this time your program is able to continue running.

If you need to run on a machine without internet, you can set `WANDB_MODE=offline` to only have metrics stored locally on your hard drive. Later you can call `wandb sync DIRECTORY` to have the data streamed to our server.
