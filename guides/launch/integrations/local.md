# Launch Local

You can run Launch on any machine where you have local access â€” for example, a cluster computer you might access via ssh. [See the main page](../) for a quickstart using Launch Local.

## Config reference

The Launch config is the JSON configuration you see when launching and editing a run from the W\&B web UI, and can also be passed in via the `--config` option in the Launch CLI. Some keys are usually autofilled for you in the web UI, but you can add others as long as they match the specification below. None of these fields are required to be edited when launching a run. Many of them can also be set via command-line options; see the `wandb launch` [CLI reference](../../../ref/cli/wandb-launch.md).
