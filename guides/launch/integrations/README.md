# Launch Integrations

Launch abstracts away the details of your infrastructure and allows you to run jobs in containerized, reproducible environments across any of the supported platforms with minimal setup. We currently support the following platforms:

* [Local](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-Lr2SEfv2R3GSuF1kZCt/s/-Lqya5RvLedGEWPhtkjU-1972196547/\~/changes/a3dLxy87tdn4RvFki14h/guides/launch/launch-integrations/launch-local)
* [Amazon SageMaker](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-Lr2SEfv2R3GSuF1kZCt/s/-Lqya5RvLedGEWPhtkjU-1972196547/\~/changes/a3dLxy87tdn4RvFki14h/guides/launch/launch-integrations/launch-with-amazon-sagemaker)
* [GCP Vertex AI](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-Lr2SEfv2R3GSuF1kZCt/s/-Lqya5RvLedGEWPhtkjU-1972196547/\~/changes/a3dLxy87tdn4RvFki14h/guides/launch/launch-integrations/launch-with-gcp-vertex-ai)
