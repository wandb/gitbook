# Environment Variables

When you're running a script in an automated environment, you can control **wandb** with environment variables set before the script runs or within the script.

```bash
# This is secret and shouldn't be checked into version control
WANDB_API_KEY=$YOUR_API_KEY
# Name and notes optional
WANDB_NAME="My first run"
WANDB_NOTES="Smaller learning rate, more regularization."
```

```bash
# Only needed if you don't checkin the wandb/settings file
WANDB_ENTITY=$username
WANDB_PROJECT=$project
```

```python
# If you don't want your script to sync to the cloud
os.environ['WANDB_MODE'] = 'offline'
```

## Optional Environment Variables

Use these optional environment variables to do things like set up authentication on remote machines.

| Variable name               | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WANDB\_API\_KEY**         | Sets the authentication key associated with your account. You can find your key on [your settings page](https://app.wandb.ai/settings). This must be set if `wandb login` hasn't been run on the remote machine.                                                                                                                         |
| **WANDB\_BASE\_URL**        | If you're using [wandb/local](../../self-hosted/) you should set this environment variable to `http://YOUR_IP:YOUR_PORT`                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **WANDB\_NAME**             | The human-readable name of your run. If not set it will be randomly generated for you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **WANDB\_NOTES**            | Longer notes about your run. Markdown is allowed and you can edit this later in the UI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **WANDB\_ENTITY**           | The entity associated with your run. If you have run `wandb init` in the directory of your training script, it will create a directory named _wandb_ and will save a default entity which can be checked into source control. If you don't want to create that file or want to override the file you can use the environmental variable. |
| **WANDB\_USERNAME**         | The username of a member of your team associated with the run. This can be used along with a service account API key to enable attribution of automated runs to members of your team.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **WANDB\_USER\_EMAIL**      | The email of a member of your team associated with the run. This can be used along with a service account API key to enable attribution of automated runs to members of your team.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **WANDB\_PROJECT**          | The project associated with your run. This can also be set with `wandb init`, but the environmental variable will override the value.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **WANDB\_MODE**             | By default this is set to _run_ which saves results to wandb. If you just want to save your run metadata locally, you can set this to _offline_.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **WANDB\_TAGS**             | A comma separated list of tags to be applied to the run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **WANDB\_DIR**              | Set this to an absolute path to store all generated files here instead of the _wandb_ directory relative to your training script. _be sure this directory exists and the user your process runs as can write to it_                                                                                                                      |
| **WANDB\_RESUME**           | By default this is set to _never_. If set to _auto_ wandb will automatically resume failed runs. If set to _must_ forces the run to exist on startup. If you want to always generate your own unique ids, set this to _allow_ and always set **WANDB\_RUN\_ID**.                                                                         |
| **WANDB\_RUN\_ID**          | Set this to a globally unique string (per project) corresponding to a single run of your script. It must be no longer than 64 characters. All non-word characters will be converted to dashes. This can be used to resume an existing run in cases of failure.                                                                           |

## Singularity Environments

If you're running containers in [Singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/index.html) you can pass environment variables by pre-pending the above variables with **SINGULARITYENV\_**. More details about Singularity environment variables can be found [here](https://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-environment-metadata#environment).

## Running on AWS

If you're running batch jobs in AWS, it's easy to authenticate your machines with your W\&B credentials. Get your API key from your [settings page](https://app.wandb.ai/settings), and set the WANDB\_API\_KEY environment variable in the [AWS batch job spec](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/job\_definition\_parameters.html#parameters).

## Common Questions

### Automated runs and service accounts

If you have automated tests or internal tools that launch runs logging to W\&B, create a **Service Account** on your team settings page. This will allow you to use a service API key for your automated jobs. If you want to attribute service account jobs to a specific user, you can use the **WANDB\_USERNAME** or **WANDB\_USER\_EMAIL** environment variables.

![Create a service account on your team settings page for automated jobs](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (32).png>)

This is useful for continuous integration and tools like TravisCI or CircleCI if you're setting up automated unit tests.

### Do environment variables overwrite the parameters passed to wandb.init()?

Arguments passed to `wandb.init` take precedence over the environment. You could call `wandb.init(dir=os.getenv("WANDB_DIR", my_default_override))` if you want to have a default other than the system default when the environment variable isn't set.

### Turn off logging

The command `wandb off` sets an environment variable, `WANDB_MODE=offline` . This stops any data from syncing from your machine to the remote wandb server. If you have multiple projects, they will all stop syncing logged data to W\&B servers.

To quiet the warning messages:

```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger("wandb")
logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)
```

### Multiple wandb users on shared machines

If you're using a shared machine and another person is a wandb user, it's easy to make sure your runs are always logged to the proper account. Set the [WANDB\_API\_KEY environment variable](environment-variables.md) to authenticate. If you source it in your env, when you log in you'll have the right credentials, or you can set the environment variable from your script.

Run this command `export WANDB_API_KEY=X` where X is your API key. When you're logged in, you can find your API key at [wandb.ai/authorize](https://app.wandb.ai/authorize).
