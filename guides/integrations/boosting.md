# XGBoost

The `wandb` library includes a special callback for [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). It's also easy to use the generic logging features of Weights & Biases to track large experiments, like hyperparameter sweeps.

```python
from wandb.xgboost import wandb_callback
import xgboost as xgb

...

bst = xgb.train(param, train_data, num_round, watchlist,
                callbacks=[wandb_callback()])
```

## Tuning your hyperparameters with Sweeps

Attaining the maximum performance out of models requires tuning hyperparameters, like tree depth and learning rate. Weights & Biases includes [Sweeps](../sweeps/), a powerful toolkit for configuring, orchestrating, and analyzing large hyperparameter testing experiments.

{% hint style="info" %}
To learn more about these tools and see an example of how to use Sweeps with XGBoost, check out [this interactive Colab notebook.](http://wandb.me/xgb-sweeps-colab)
