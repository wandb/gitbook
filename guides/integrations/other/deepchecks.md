# DeepChecks

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepchecks/deepchecks/blob/0.5.0-1-g5380093/docs/source/examples/guides/export\_outputs\_to\_wandb.ipynb)

DeepChecks helps you validate your machine learning models and data, such as verifying your dataâ€™s integrity, inspecting its distributions, validating data splits, evaluating your model and comparing between different models, all with with minimal effort.&#x20;

[Read more about DeepChecks and the wandb integration ->](https://docs.deepchecks.com/en/stable/examples/guides/export\_outputs\_to\_wandb.html)

## Getting Started

To use DeepChecks with Weights & Biases you will first need to sign up for a Weights & Biases account [here](https://wandb.ai/site).  With the Weights & Biases integration in DeepChecks you can quickly get started like so:

```python
import wandb
wandb.login()

# import your check from deepchecks
from deepchecks.checks import ModelErrorAnalysis

# run your check
result = ModelErrorAnalysis()...

# push that result to wandb
result.to_wandb()
```

You can also log an entire DeepChecks test suite to Weights & Biases

```python
import wandb
wandb.login()

# import your full_suite tests from deepchecks
from deepchecks.suites import full_suite

# create and run a DeepChecks test suite
suite_result = full_suite().run(...)

# push thes results to wandb
# here you can pass any wandb.init configs and arguments you need
suite_result.to_wandb(
    project='my-suite-project', 
    config={'suite-name': 'full-suite'}
)
```

## Example
