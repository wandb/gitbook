# OpenAI Gym

If you're using [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) we will automatically log videos of your environment generated by `gym.wrappers.Monitor`. Just set the `monitor_gym` keyword argument to [`wandb.init`](../../../ref/python/init.md) to `True` or call `wandb.gym.monitor()`.

Our gym integration is very light. We simply [look at the name of the video file](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/blob/master/wandb/integration/gym/\_\_init\_\_.py#L15) being logged from `gym` and name it after that or fall back to `"videos"` if we don't find a match. If you want more control, you can always just manually [log a video](../../track/create-a-new-artifact-version/media.md).

The [OpenRL Benchmark](http://wandb.me/openrl-benchmark-report) by[ CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) uses this integration for its OpenAI Gym examples. You can find source code (including [the specific code used for specific runs](https://wandb.ai/cleanrl/cleanrl.benchmark/runs/2jrqfugg/code?workspace=user-costa-huang)) that demonstrates how to use gym with
