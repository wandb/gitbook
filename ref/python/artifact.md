[![](https://www.tensorflow.org/images/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)View source on GitHub](https://www.github.com/wandb/client/tree/latest/wandb/sdk/wandb_artifacts.py#L78-L714)



Flexible and lightweight building block for dataset and model versioning.

```python
Artifact(
    name: str,
    type: str,
    description: Optional[str] = None,
    metadata: Optional[dict] = None,
    incremental: Optional[bool] = None,
    use_as: Optional[str] = None
) -> None
```




Constructs an empty artifact whose contents can be populated using its
`add` family of functions. Once the artifact has all the desired files,
you can call `wandb.log_artifact()` to log it.

| Arguments |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  `name` |  (str) A human-readable name for this artifact, which is how you can identify this artifact in the UI or reference it in `use_artifact` calls. Names can contain letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and dots. The name must be unique across a project. |
|  `type` |  (str) The type of the artifact, which is used to organize and differentiate artifacts. Common types include `dataset` or `model`, but you can use any string containing letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and dots. |
|  `description` |  (str, optional) Free text that offers a description of the artifact. The description is markdown rendered in the UI, so this is a good place to place tables, links, etc. |
|  `metadata` |  (dict, optional) Structured data associated with the artifact, for example class distribution of a dataset. This will eventually be queryable and plottable in the UI. There is a hard limit of 100 total keys. |



#### Examples:

Basic usage
```
wandb.init()

artifact = wandb.Artifact('mnist', type='dataset')
artifact.add_dir('mnist/')
wandb.log_artifact(artifact)
```



| Raises |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  `Exception` |  if problem. |



| Returns |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  An `Artifact` object. |





| Attributes |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  `aliases` |  Returns: (list): A list of the aliases associated with this artifact. The list is mutable and calling `save()` will persist all alias changes. |
|  `commit_hash` |  Returns: (str): The artifact's commit hash which is used in http URLs |
|  `description` |  Returns: (str): Free text that offers a description of the artifact. The description is markdown rendered in the UI, so this is a good place to put links, etc. |
|  `digest` |  Returns: (str): The artifact's logical digest, a checksum of its contents. If an artifact has the same digest as the current `latest` version, then `log_artifact` is a no-op. |
|  `entity` |  Returns: (str): The name of the entity this artifact belongs to. |
|  `id` |  Returns: (str): The artifact's ID |
|  `manifest` |  Returns: (ArtifactManifest): The artifact's manifest, listing all of its contents. You cannot add more files to an artifact once you've retrieved its manifest. |
|  `metadata` |  Returns: (dict): Structured data associated with the artifact, for example class distribution of a dataset. This will eventually be queryable and plottable in the UI. There is a hard limit of 100 total keys. |
|  `name` |  Returns: (str): The artifact's name |
|  `project` |  Returns: (str): The name of the project this artifact belongs to. |
|  `size` |  Returns: (int): The size in bytes of the artifact. Includes any references tracked by this artifact. |
|  `state` |  Returns: (str): The state of the artifact, which can be one of "PENDING", "COMMITTED", or "DELETED". |
|  `type` |  Returns: (str): The artifact's type |
|  `version` |  Returns: (int): The version of this artifact. For example, if this is the first version of an artifact, its `version` will be 'v0'. |

<h3 id="add_reference"><code>add_reference</code></h3>

[View source](https://www.github.com/wandb/client/tree/latest/wandb/sdk/wandb_artifacts.py#L425-L457)

```python
add_reference(
    uri: Union[ArtifactEntry, str],
    name: Optional[str] = None,
    checksum: bool = (True),
    max_objects: Optional[int] = None
) -> Sequence[ArtifactEntry]
```

Adds a reference denoted by a URI to the artifact. Unlike adding files or directories,
references are NOT uploaded to W&B. However, artifact methods such as `download()` can
be used regardless of whether the artifact contains references or uploaded files.

By default, W&B offers special
handling for the following schemes:

- http(s): The size and digest of the file will be inferred by the `Content-Length` and
    the `ETag` response headers returned by the server.
- s3: The checksum and size will be pulled from the object metadata. If bucket versioning
    is enabled, then the version ID is also tracked.
- gs: The checksum and size will be pulled from the object metadata. If bucket versioning
    is enabled, then the version ID is also tracked.
- file: The checksum and size will be pulled from the file system. This scheme is useful if
    you have an NFS share or other externally mounted volume containing files you wish to track
    but not necessarily upload.

For any other scheme, the digest is just a hash of the URI and the size is left blank.

| Arguments |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  `uri` |  (str) The URI path of the reference to add. Can be an object returned from Artifact.get_path to store a reference to another artifact's entry. |
|  `name` |  (str) The path within the artifact to place the contents of this reference |
|  `checksum` |  (bool, optional) Whether or not to checksum the resource(s) located at the reference URI. Checksumming is strongly recommended as it enables automatic integrity validation, however it can be disabled to speed up artifact creation. (default: True) |
|  `max_objects` |  (int, optional) The maximum number of objects to consider when adding a reference that points to directory or bucket store prefix. For S3 and GCS, this limit is 10,000 by default but is uncapped for other URI schemes. (default: None) |



| Raises |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  `Exception` |  If problem. |



| Returns |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  List[ArtifactManifestEntry]: The added manifest entries. |



#### Examples:

Adding an HTTP link:
```
# Adds `file.txt` to the root of the artifact as a reference
artifact.add_reference('http://myserver.com/file.txt')
```

Adding an S3 prefix without an explicit name:
```
# All objects under `prefix/` will be added at the root of the artifact.
artifact.add_reference('s3://mybucket/prefix')
```

Adding a GCS prefix with an explicit name:
```
# All objects under `prefix/` will be added under `path/` at the top of the artifact.
artifact.add_reference('gs://mybucket/prefix', name='path')
```
