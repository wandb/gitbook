Use the Public API to export or update data that you have saved to W&B.


Before using this API, you'll want to log data from your script â€” check the
[Quickstart](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart) for more details.

You might use the Public API to
 - update metadata or metrics for an experiment after it has been completed,
 - pull down your results as a dataframe for post-hoc analysis in a Jupyter notebook, or
 - check your saved model artifacts for those tagged as `ready-to-deploy`.

For more on using the Public API, check out [our guide](https://docs.wandb.com/guides/track/public-api-guide).
