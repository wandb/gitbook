Format images with 2D bounding box overlays for logging to W&B.

```python
BoundingBoxes2D(
    val: dict,
    key: str
) -> None
```





| Arguments |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  `val` |  (dictionary) A dictionary of the following form: box_data: (list of dictionaries) One dictionary for each bounding box, containing: position: (dictionary) the position and size of the bounding box, in one of two formats Note that boxes need not all use the same format. {"minX", "minY", "maxX", "maxY"}: (dictionary) A set of coordinates defining the upper and lower bounds of the box (the bottom left and top right corners) {"middle", "width", "height"}: (dictionary) A set of coordinates defining the center and dimensions of the box, with "middle" as a list [x, y] for the center point and "width" and "height" as numbers domain: (string) One of two options for the bounding box coordinate domain null: By default, or if no argument is passed, the coordinate domain is assumed to be relative to the original image, expressing this box as a fraction or percentage of the original image. This means all coordinates and dimensions passed into the "position" argument are floating point numbers between 0 and 1. "pixel": (string literal) The coordinate domain is set to the pixel space. This means all coordinates and dimensions passed into "position" are integers within the bounds of the image dimensions. class_id: (integer) The class label id for this box scores: (dictionary of string to number, optional) A mapping of named fields to numerical values (float or int), can be used for filtering boxes in the UI based on a range of values for the corresponding field box_caption: (string, optional) A string to be displayed as the label text above this box in the UI, often composed of the class label, class name, and/or scores class_labels: (dictionary, optional) A map of integer class labels to their readable class names |
|  `key` |  (string) The readable name or id for this set of bounding boxes (e.g. predictions, ground_truth) |



#### Examples:

### Log bounding boxes for a single image
<!--yeadoc-test:boundingbox-2d-->
```python
import numpy as np
import wandb

wandb.init()
image = np.random.randint(low=0, high=256, size=(200, 300, 3))

class_labels = {
    0: "person",
    1: "car",
    2: "road",
    3: "building"
}

img = wandb.Image(image, boxes={
    "predictions": {
        "box_data": [
            {
                # one box expressed in the default relative/fractional domain

                    "minX": 0.1,
                    "maxX": 0.2,
                    "minY": 0.3,
                    "maxY": 0.4
                },
                "class_id" : 1,
                "box_caption": class_labels[1],
                "scores" : {
                    "acc": 0.2,
                    "loss": 1.2
                }
            },
            {
                # another box expressed in the pixel domain
                "position": {
                    "middle": [150, 20],
                    "width": 68,
                    "height": 112
                },
                "domain" : "pixel",
                "class_id" : 3,
                "box_caption": "a building",
                "scores" : {
                    "acc": 0.5,
                    "loss": 0.7
                }
            },
            # Log as many boxes an as needed
        ],
        "class_labels": class_labels
    }
})

wandb.log({"driving_scene": img})
```

### Log a bounding box overlay to a Table
