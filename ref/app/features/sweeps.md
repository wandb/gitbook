# Sweeps UI

Use the [sweep docs](../../../guides/sweeps/) to create a YAML file and run sweeps from the command line.

The state (**State**), creation time (**Created**), the entity that started the sweep (**Creator**), the number of runs completed (**Run count**), and the time it took to compute the sweep (**Compute time**) are displayed in the Sweeps UI. The expected number of runs a sweep will create (**Est. Runs**) is provided when you do a grid search over a discrete search space.&#x20;



Click on a sweep to manage the state of the sweep. You can pause, resume, stop, or kill a sweep from the interface.
