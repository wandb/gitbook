### Add Emails

Select **+ Add Email** to add an email. This will take you to an Auth0 page. You can enter in the credentials for the new email or connect using single sign-on (SSO).

### Delete Emails

Select the kebab dropdown and choose **Delete Emails** to delete an email that is registered to your Weights & Biases account

{% hint style="info" %}
Primary emails cannot be deleted; you need to set a different email as a primary email before deleting
{% endhint %}

### Email Types

There are three email types:

* Corporate - an email associated with a company, usually in the company's domain
* Academic - an email associated with an academic institution
* Personal - an email that does not fall under Corporate or Academic

Email Types are automatically detected when you add a new email. You can optionally manually set the email type. Use the kebab dropdown to manually set the email type.

If the email type is not validated a dispute modal will appear and ask you to contact support. Email validation can fail, for example, if you attempt to set an academic or personal email to a corporate email type.

### Login methods

The Login Methods column displays the login methods that are associated with your account.

A verification email is sent to your email account when you create a Weights & Biases account. Your email account is considered unverified until you verify your email address. Unverified emails are displayed in red.

Attempt to log in with your email address again to retrieve a second verification email if you no longer have the original verification email that was sent to your email account.

Contact support@wandb.com for account login issues.
